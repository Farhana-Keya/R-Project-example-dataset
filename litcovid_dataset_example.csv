2,2,32432804,Impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome on blood services and blood in Hong Kong in 2003.,"Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) on Blood Services and Blood in Hong Kong in 2003

Summary

The current global pandemic of COVID-19 due to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is causing considerable loss of life and enormous social and economic disruption. Here, we describe the response of the blood service, the impact on blood donation and the effects on the blood supply in Hong Kong posed by the earlier SARS epidemic in 2002 and 2003. The infection, like SARS-CoV-2 was highly contagious through droplet transmission.

In the 2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, donor and staff safety was secured by using stringent infection control measures to protect both donors and staff from contacting the virus. All the donors were requested to wear face masks within the donation venue and use an alcohol-based hand rinse. The donors' body temperature was checked before donation and staff's body temperatures were checked daily. The safety of the blood supply was secured by a donor deferral policy for 4 weeks following contact with a confirmed or suspected case of and a post-donation call-back system. Despite scheduling mobile donation sessions and a decrease in donors attending blood donor centers, the blood supply was maintained as there was a 12.8% reduction of the demand of blood and only a 16.9% reduction in the blood donation.

Lessons learnt during the epidemic may help preparation for future epidemics and provide a basis for understanding the pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis and role of coronaviruses in transfusion medicine. These are continuing problems as coronavirus epidemics may recur with future impact on blood collection and blood donation screening.

The airway epithelial barrier is a major barrier protecting against clinically significant infections of the lung. Its integrity is often compromised due to mechanical, chemical, or infectious causes. Opportunistic bacterial pathogens are poised to cause parenchymal infection and become difficult to eradicate due to adaptive metabolic changes, biofilm formation, and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and fitness genes. Enhancing mucosal defenses by modulating the cytokines that regulate barrier functions, such as interleukin-22 (IL-22) and interferon-lambda (IFN-lambda), members of the IL-10 family of cytokines, is an attractive approach to prevent these infections that are associated with high morbidity and mortality. These cytokines both signal through the cognate receptor IL-10RB, have related protein structures and common downstream signaling suggesting shared roles in host respiratory defense. They are typically co-expressed in multiple models of infections, but with differing kinetics. IL-22 has an important role in the producing antimicrobial peptides, upregulating expression of junctional proteins in the airway epithelium and working in concert with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17. Conversely, IFN-lambda, a potent antiviral in influenza infection with pro-inflammatory properties, appears to decrease junctional integrity allowing for bacterial and immune cell translocation. The effects of these cytokines are pleotropic, with pathogen and tissue specific consequences. Understanding how these cytokines work in the mucosal defenses of the respiratory system may suggest potential targets to prevent invasive infections of the damaged lung.","participation of the il-10rb related cytokines , il-22 and ifn-lambda in defense of the airway mucosal barrier . \n\n the airway epithelial barrier is a major barrier protecting against clinically significant infections of the lung . its integrity is often compromised due to mechanical , chemical , or infectious causes . opportunistic bacterial pathogens are poised to cause parenchymal infection and become difficult to eradicate due to adaptive metabolic changes , biofilm formation , and the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and fitness genes . enhancing mucosal defenses by modulating the cytokines that regulate barrier functions , such as interleukin-22 ( il-22 ) and interferon-lambda ( ifn-lambda ) , members of the il-10 family of cytokines , is an attractive approach to prevent these infections that are associated with high morbidity and mortality . these cytokines both signal through the cognate receptor il-10rb , have related protein structures and common downstream signaling suggesting shared roles in host respiratory defense . they are typically co-expressed in multiple models of infections , but with differing kinetics . il-22 has an important role in the producing antimicrobial peptides , upregulating expression of junctional proteins in the airway epithelium and working in concert with other inflammatory cytokines such as il-17 . conversely , ifn-lambda , a potent antiviral in influenza infection with pro-inflammatory properties , appears to decrease junctional integrity allowing for bacterial and immune cell translocation . the effects of these cytokines are pleotropic , with pathogen and tissue specific consequences . understanding how these cytokines work in the mucosal defenses of the respiratory system may suggest potential targets to prevent invasive infections of the damaged lung .

The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. At present, there is no definite and effective treatment for COVID-19. ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. Animal studies have shown that RAS inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure. The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.","[ inhibitors of ras might be a good choice for the therapy of covid-19 pneumonia ] . \n\n the novel coronavirus 2019 ( covid-19 ) infected patients by binding human ace2 , leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients . at present , there is no definite and effective treatment for covid-19 . ace2 plays an important role in the ras , and the imbalance between ace/ang ii/at1r pathway and ace2/ang ( 1-7 ) /mas receptor pathway in the ras system will lead to multi-system inflammation . increased ace and ang ii are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia . animal studies have shown that ras inhibitors could effectively relieve symptoms of acute severe pneumonia and respiratory failure . the binding of covid-19 and ace2 resulted in the exhaustion of ace2 , and then ace2/ang ( 1-7 ) /mas receptor pathway was inhibited . the balance of the ras system was broken , and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia . therefore , we speculate that acei and at1r inhibitors could be used in patients with covid-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure , and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality .

The Swedish strategy for dealing with covid-19 has been criticized for not accounting for difficulties of conducting voluntary social distancing in settings with household overcrowding, dependence on public transport and large proportion of service sector workers. In such neighbourhoods there is typically a larger proportion of immigrants. We compared all-cause-mortality data in Sweden by country of origin from 2020 and 2016-2019 and found large disparities. The number of deaths among persons born in countries from which many refugees have migrated to Sweden in the last decades was 220% higher in March-May 2020 compared to the mean in 2016-2019. In contrast, there was no increased mortality among persons aged 40-64 years and a 19% increased number of deaths of those aged above 65 years born in Sweden, EU or North America during these three months. These observations further illustrate the need for a dedicated and more diverse strategy in dealing with the covid-19 pandemic.","[ large differences in excess mortality in march-may 2020 by country of birth in sweden ] . \n\n the swedish strategy for dealing with covid-19 has been criticized for not accounting for difficulties of conducting voluntary social distancing in settings with household overcrowding , dependence on public transport and large proportion of service sector workers . in such neighbourhoods there is typically a larger proportion of immigrants . we compared all-cause-mortality data in sweden by country of origin from 2020 and 2016-2019 and found large disparities . the number of deaths among persons born in countries from which many refugees have migrated to sweden in the last decades was 220 % higher in march-may 2020 compared to the mean in 2016-2019 . in contrast , there was no increased mortality among persons aged 40-64 years and a 19 % increased number of deaths of those aged above 65 years born in sweden , eu or north america during these three months . these observations further illustrate the need for a dedicated and more diverse strategy in dealing with the covid-19 pandemic .

INTRODUCTION: Demonstrating the results of Social Distancing Strategies (SDS) became a relevant factor to obtain support by the population in Sao Paulo State and in Brazil. The delay in the processing of PCR tests and the small number of tests available limits the ability of sanitary authorities to make meaningful data available as to the number of cases or the number of deaths due to COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: We use a time series analysis of deaths due to COVID-19 referenced to the date of deaths (as opposed to the date in which the test results were obtained). RESULTS: We demonstrate that the SDS adopted in Sao Paulo City and State clearly brought meaningful results to delay the growth of COVID-19 cases. We also show that by using this type of time series it is possible to identify different trends for regions, allowing for targeted approaches. Additionally, by using a time series which is death-oriented makes it possible to identify, for Sao Paulo City, the effects of the SDS with the Social Isolation Index (SII) adopted in the state and to make a gross estimate for the SII, which prevents the growth of the disease. CONCLUSION: The use of a time series of deaths due to COVID-19 referenced to the date of the event allows a better understanding of the effects of the SDS on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic in Sao Paulo State, Brazil.","social distancing in sao paulo state : demonstrating the reduction in cases using time series analysis of deaths due to covid-19 . \n\n introduction : demonstrating the results of social distancing strategies ( sds ) became a relevant factor to obtain support by the population in sao paulo state and in brazil . the delay in the processing of pcr tests and the small number of tests available limits the ability of sanitary authorities to make meaningful data available as to the number of cases or the number of deaths due to covid-19 . methodology : we use a time series analysis of deaths due to covid-19 referenced to the date of deaths ( as opposed to the date in which the test results were obtained ) . results : we demonstrate that the sds adopted in sao paulo city and state clearly brought meaningful results to delay the growth of covid-19 cases . we also show that by using this type of time series it is possible to identify different trends for regions , allowing for targeted approaches . additionally , by using a time series which is death-oriented makes it possible to identify , for sao paulo city , the effects of the sds with the social isolation index ( sii ) adopted in the state and to make a gross estimate for the sii , which prevents the growth of the disease . conclusion : the use of a time series of deaths due to covid-19 referenced to the date of the event allows a better understanding of the effects of the sds on the progression of the covid-19 epidemic in sao paulo state , brazil .

BACKGROUND: Novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) has spread in the world since its first human infection in December 2019. India has also witnessed a rising number of infections since March 2020. The Indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus. Tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind. AIM: Through this article, an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of Indian people using Python and R statistical software, during the recent lockdown 2.0 (15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020) and lockdown 3.0 (4 May 2020 to 17 May 2020) through their tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Also, opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed. METHOD: Analysis has been performed using Python and R statistical software. Also, recent articles related to COVID-19 have been considered and reviewed. RESULT: Although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness, disgust and others, the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0. CONCLUSION: This analysis can help the health specialists to understand people's mind-set, the authorities to take further corresponding measures in washing out the virus and the e-commerce stakeholders to adapt to the changing attitudes by adjusting demand and supply plans accordingly.","covid-19 pandemic lockdown : an emotional health perspective of indians on twitter . \n\n background : novel corona virus ( 2019-ncov ) has spread in the world since its first human infection in december 2019 . india has also witnessed a rising number of infections since march 2020 . the indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus . tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind . aim : through this article , an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of indian people using python and r statistical software , during the recent lockdown 2.0 ( 15 april 2020 to 3 may 2020 ) and lockdown 3.0 ( 4 may 2020 to 17 may 2020 ) through their tweets on the social media platform twitter . also , opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed . method : analysis has been performed using python and r statistical software . also , recent articles related to covid-19 have been considered and reviewed . result : although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness , disgust and others , the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0 . conclusion : this analysis can help the health specialists to understand people 's mind-set , the authorities to take further corresponding measures in washing out the virus and the e-commerce stakeholders to adapt to the changing attitudes by adjusting demand and supply plans accordingly .

To the editor:

Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, including advanced heart failure, are at higher risk of mortality and morbidity associating with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In that context, I raise several questions about report of Singh and colleagues, presenting a patient who suffered from COVID-19 during durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Patients with mechanical support may be at risk and challenge clinicians in new ways if infected with the virus.

First, implementation of prone positioning is recommended in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome to improve oxygenation, but the authors did not perform such a procedure. Can the authors expand on their concerns about the safety and efficacy of such a procedure in patients with LVADs?

Second, severe COVID-19 infection might further worsen right ventricular function during LVAD support due to increased afterload on the right ventricle. When should clinicians assess right ventricular function and how should it be managed? 

Finally, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be considered for severe respiratory failure including COVID-19 infection. I would like to know whether the authors would consider such an intervention in patients with LVADs and severe COVID-19 infection.

12,12,32614689,Patients Perceptions of Telemedicine Visits Before and After the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.,"Patients Perceptions of Telemedicine Visits Before and After the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic.

Purpose: This study sought to determine whether the necessitated use of telemedicine due to coronavirus disease 2019, and limited choice of both the provider and patient, impacts the perceptions of telemedicine by patients who experienced telemedicine prepandemic and those who first experienced telemedicine during the pandemic. Methodology: Participants for this survey were a convenience sample. An invitation to participate was shared through social media and e-mail listservs. To participate, individuals had to be at least 18 years of age and gave consent to their data being used. The online survey took ~10-15 min to complete, the survey was available from March 31 to April 20, 2020. Results: Two hundred sixty-four (n = 264, 60.8%) individuals had used telemedicine on or before December 2019 and 170 (39.2%) individuals used telemedicine for the first time January 2020 or later. There were no significant differences in demographics between groups, except that new users were more likely to have a primary care physician [F(407) = 13.51, p < 0.001]. Satisfaction of telemedicine was measured using a 10-item scale, demonstrating that all participants were overall satisfied with their telemedicine experience(s), (mean = 1.67, standard deviation = 0.61). Broadly, the differences in perceptions between the groups included the reasons for using telemedicine, perceptions of quality of in-person care, continuity of care, and a technical issue. Conclusions: Overall, patients are satisfied using telemedicine, however, for new users, both providers and patients, some acclimation needs to occur.","patients perceptions of telemedicine visits before and after the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic . \n\n purpose : this study sought to determine whether the necessitated use of telemedicine due to coronavirus disease 2019 , and limited choice of both the provider and patient , impacts the perceptions of telemedicine by patients who experienced telemedicine prepandemic and those who first experienced telemedicine during the pandemic . methodology : participants for this survey were a convenience sample . an invitation to participate was shared through social media and e-mail listservs . to participate , individuals had to be at least 18 years of age and gave consent to their data being used . the online survey took ~10-15 min to complete , the survey was available from march 31 to april 20 , 2020 . results : two hundred sixty-four ( n = 264 , 60.8 % ) individuals had used telemedicine on or before december 2019 and 170 ( 39.2 % ) individuals used telemedicine for the first time january 2020 or later . there were no significant differences in demographics between groups , except that new users were more likely to have a primary care physician [ f ( 407 ) = 13.51 , p < 0.001 ] . satisfaction of telemedicine was measured using a 10-item scale , demonstrating that all participants were overall satisfied with their telemedicine experience ( s ) , ( mean = 1.67 , standard deviation = 0.61 ) . broadly , the differences in perceptions between the groups included the reasons for using telemedicine , perceptions of quality of in-person care , continuity of care , and a technical issue . conclusions : overall , patients are satisfied using telemedicine , however , for new users , both providers and patients , some acclimation needs to occur .

OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic that has caused severe health threats and fatalities in almost all communities. Studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 in saliva with a viral load that lasts for a long period. However, researchers are yet to establish whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly enter the salivary glands. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the presence of ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression in salivary glands using publicly available databases. METHODS: The distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSSs family in salivary gland tissue and other tissues was analyzed. The GTEx dataset was employed to explore the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in various body organs and salivary glands in a healthy population. The single-cell sequencing data for salivary gland samples (including submandibular salivary gland and parotid gland) from mice were collected and analyzed. The components and proportions of salivary gland cells expressing the key protease TMPRSSs family were analyzed. RESULTS: Transcriptome data analysis showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in salivary glands. The expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were marginal without significant differences in different age groups or between men and women. Single-cell RNA sequence analysis indicated that TMPRSS2 was mainly expressed in salivary gland epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: We speculate that SARS-CoV-2 may be entered in salivary glands.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a major international emergency leading to unprecedented medical, economic and societal challenges. Countries around the globe are facing challenges with diabetes care and are similarly adapting care delivery, with local cultural nuances. People with diabetes suffer disproportionately from acute COVID-19 with higher rates of serious complications and death. In-patient services need specialist support to appropriately manage glycaemia in people with known and undiagnosed diabetes presenting with COVID-19. Due to the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, people with diabetes may suffer longer-term harm caused by inadequate clinical support and less frequent monitoring of their condition and diabetes-related complications. Outpatient services need reorganised to maintain advice and support, focusing on proactive care for the highest risk, making use of telehealth and digital services for consultations, self-management and remote monitoring, where appropriate. Stratification of patients for face-to-face or remote follow-up should be based on a balanced risk assessment. Public health and national organisations have generally responded rapidly with guidance on care management, but the pandemic has created a tension around prioritisation of communicable vs non-communicable disease.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2, a new member of the genus Betacoronavirus, is a pandemic virus, which has caused numerous fatalities, particularly in the elderly and persons with underlying morbidities. At present, there are no approved vaccines nor antiviral therapies available. The detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies plays a crucial role in the assessment of the immune status of convalescent COVID-19 patients, evaluation of recombinant therapeutic antibodies, and the evaluation of novel vaccines. To detect SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies, classically, a virus-neutralization test has to be performed at biosafety level 3, considerably limiting the general use of this test. In the present work, a biosafety level 1 pseudotype virus assay based on a propagation-incompetent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been used to determine the neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent COVID-19 patients. The neutralization titers in serum of two independently analyzed patient cohorts were available within 18 h and correlated well with those obtained with a classical SARS-CoV-2 neutralization test (Pearson correlation coefficients of r = 0.929 and r = 0.939, respectively). Most convalescent COVID-19 patients had only low titers of neutralizing antibodies (ND50 < 320). The sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients also neutralized pseudotype virus displaying the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein on their surface, which is homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In summary, we report a robust virus-neutralization assay, which can be used at low biosafety level 1 to rapidly quantify SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinated individuals.","rapid quantification of sars-cov-2-neutralizing antibodies using propagation-defective vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes . \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 ( sars-cov-2 , a new member of the genus betacoronavirus , is a pandemic virus , which has caused numerous fatalities , particularly in the elderly and persons with underlying morbidities . at present , there are no approved vaccines nor antiviral therapies available . the detection and quantification of sars-cov-2-neutralizing antibodies plays a crucial role in the assessment of the immune status of convalescent covid-19 patients , evaluation of recombinant therapeutic antibodies , and the evaluation of novel vaccines . to detect sars-cov-2-neutralizing antibodies , classically , a virus-neutralization test has to be performed at biosafety level 3 , considerably limiting the general use of this test . in the present work , a biosafety level 1 pseudotype virus assay based on a propagation-incompetent vesicular stomatitis virus ( vsv ) has been used to determine the neutralizing antibody titers in convalescent covid-19 patients . the neutralization titers in serum of two independently analyzed patient cohorts were available within 18 h and correlated well with those obtained with a classical sars-cov-2 neutralization test ( pearson correlation coefficients of r = 0.929 and r = 0.939 , respectively ) . most convalescent covid-19 patients had only low titers of neutralizing antibodies ( nd50 < 320 ) . the sera of convalescent covid-19 patients also neutralized pseudotype virus displaying the sars-cov-1 spike protein on their surface , which is homologous to the sars-cov-2 spike protein . in summary , we report a robust virus-neutralization assay , which can be used at low biosafety level 1 to rapidly quantify sars-cov-2-neutralizing antibodies in convalescent covid-19 patients and vaccinated individuals .

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been rapidly spreading all over the world and is responsible for the current pandemic. The current pandemic has found the Italian national health system unprepared to provide an appropriate and prompt response, heavily affecting surgical activities. Based on the limited data available in the literature and personal experiences, the Societa Italiana di Chirurgia dell'OBesita e Malattie Metaboliche (SICOB) provides recommendations regarding the triage of bariatric surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic defining a dedicated path for surgery in morbidly obese patients with known or suspected COVID-19 who may require emergency operations. Finally, the current paper delineates a strategy to resume outpatient visits and elective bariatric surgery once the acute phase of the pandemic is over. Models developed during the COVID-19 crisis should be integrated into hospital practices for future use in similar scenarios. Surgeons are presented with a golden opportunity to embrace systemic change and to drive their professional future.","bariatric surgery and the covid-19 pandemic : sicob recommendations on how to perform surgery during the outbreak and when to resume the activities in phase 2 of lockdown . \n\n the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) and its related disease , coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , has been rapidly spreading all over the world and is responsible for the current pandemic . the current pandemic has found the italian national health system unprepared to provide an appropriate and prompt response , heavily affecting surgical activities . based on the limited data available in the literature and personal experiences , the societa italiana di chirurgia dell'obesita e malattie metaboliche ( sicob ) provides recommendations regarding the triage of bariatric surgical procedures during the covid-19 pandemic defining a dedicated path for surgery in morbidly obese patients with known or suspected covid-19 who may require emergency operations . finally , the current paper delineates a strategy to resume outpatient visits and elective bariatric surgery once the acute phase of the pandemic is over . models developed during the covid-19 crisis should be integrated into hospital practices for future use in similar scenarios . surgeons are presented with a golden opportunity to embrace systemic change and to drive their professional future .

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of original peer-reviewed studies, containing data on the identification of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood, and human milk, from women with a clinically or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. These studies should have been published after the guide for the management of patients with COVID-19 from World Health Organization guide (available in March 13, 2020). RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included, in which 143 clinical samples were identified (38 of amniotic fluid; 34 of placentas or membranes; 39 from umbilical cord blood and 32 from human milk). Among the 143 samples, nine were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (one amniotic fluid sample obtained before rupturing the membranes; six samples of placenta or membranes, although authors indicate the possibility of contamination by maternal blood in three of these, and two samples of human milk). CONCLUSIONS: Following our search criteria, we found no studies that demonstrate the detection of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with viral isolation and the evaluation of the infective capacity of viral particles, in clinical samples of amniotic fluid, placenta or membranes, umbilical cord blood and human milk, from women with a confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: During coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, reducing the number of invasive procedure and choosing conservative medication strategy for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is unavoidable. Whether this relatively conservative strategy will impact in-hospital outcome for NSTEMI patients remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: The current study included all consecutive NSTEMI patients who visited the emergency department in Fuwai Hospital from February 1 to March 31, 2020 and all the NSTEMI patients in the same period of 2019 as a historical control. Very-high-risk patients were defined as clinical presentation of heart failure, cardiac shock, cardiac arrest, recurrent chest pain, and life-threatening arrhythmias. The primary outcome was in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or heart failure. A total of 115 NSTEMI patients were enrolled since the outbreak of COVID-19, and a total of 145 patients were included in the control group. There was a tendency toward higher MACE risk in 2020 compared with 2019 (18.3% vs. 11.7%, p = .14).

BACKGROUND: There is sufficient epidemiological and biological evidence of increased human susceptibility to viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and influenza virus, in cold weather. The pattern of outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China during the flu season is further proof that meteorological conditions may potentially influence the susceptibility of human populations to coronaviruses, a situation that may become increasingly evident as the current global pandemic of COVID-19 unfolds. MAIN BODY: A very rapid spread and high mortality rates have characterized the COVID-19 pandemic in countries north of the equator where air temperatures have been seasonally low. It is unclear if the currently high rates of COVID-19 infections in countries of the northern hemisphere will wane during the summer months, or if fewer people overall will become infected with COVID-19 in countries south of the equator where warmer weather conditions prevail through most of the year. However, apart from the influence of seasons, evidence based on the structural biology and biochemical properties of many enveloped viruses similar to the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (aetiology of COVID-19), support the higher likelihood of the latter of the two outcomes. Other factors that may potentially impact the rate of virus spread include the effectiveness of infection control practices, individual and herd immunity, and emergency preparedness levels of countries.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Hospitals and healthcare providers are preparing for the anticipated surge in critically ill patients but few are wholly equipped to manage this new disease. We all must do our part to prepare our patients, clinics, and hospitals for the drastic changes necessary to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 or we risk overwhelming the capacity of our healthcare system. The goals of this document are to provide data on what is currently known about COVID-19, and how it may impact hepatologists and liver transplant providers and their patients. Our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers.","clinical best practice advice for hepatology and liver transplant providers during the covid-19 pandemic : aasld expert panel consensus statement \n\n abstract \n\n coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) , the illness caused by the sars-cov-2 virus , is rapidly spreading throughout the world . hospitals and healthcare providers are preparing for the anticipated surge in critically ill patients but few are wholly equipped to manage this new disease . we all must do our part to prepare our patients , clinics , and hospitals for the drastic changes necessary to mitigate the spread of sars-cov-2 or we risk overwhelming the capacity of our healthcare system . the goals of this document are to provide data on what is currently known about covid-19 , and how it may impact hepatologists and liver transplant providers and their patients . our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers .

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This pandemic is characterized by a high variability in death rate (defined as the ratio between the number of deaths and the total number of infected people) across world countries. Several possible explanations have been proposed, but it is not clear whether this variability is due to a single predominant factor or instead to multiple causes. Here we addressed this issue using multivariable regression analysis to test the impact of the following factors: the hospital stress (defined as the ratio between the number of infected cases and the total number of hospital beds), the population median age, and the quality of the National Health System (NHS). For this analysis, we chose countries of the world with over 3000 infected cases as of April 1, 2020. Hospital stress was found to be the crucial factor in explaining the variability of death rate, while the others had negligible relevance. Different procedures for quantifying cases of infection and death for COVID-19 could affect the variability in death rate across countries. We therefore applied the same statistical approach to Italy, which is divided into 20 Regions that share the same protocol for counting the outcomes of this pandemic. Correlation between hospital stress and death rate was even stronger than that observed for countries of the world. Based on our findings and the historical trend for the availability of hospital beds, we propose guidelines for policy-makers to properly manage future pandemics.","how to minimize the impact of pandemic events : lessons from the covid-19 crisis . \n\n severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars-cov-2 ) is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 ( covid-19 ) . this pandemic is characterized by a high variability in death rate ( defined as the ratio between the number of deaths and the total number of infected people ) across world countries . several possible explanations have been proposed , but it is not clear whether this variability is due to a single predominant factor or instead to multiple causes . here we addressed this issue using multivariable regression analysis to test the impact of the following factors : the hospital stress ( defined as the ratio between the number of infected cases and the total number of hospital beds ) , the population median age , and the quality of the national health system ( nhs ) . for this analysis , we chose countries of the world with over 3000 infected cases as of april 1 , 2020 . hospital stress was found to be the crucial factor in explaining the variability of death rate , while the others had negligible relevance . different procedures for quantifying cases of infection and death for covid-19 could affect the variability in death rate across countries . we therefore applied the same statistical approach to italy , which is divided into 20 regions that share the same protocol for counting the outcomes of this pandemic . correlation between hospital stress and death rate was even stronger than that observed for countries of the world . based on our findings and the historical trend for the availability of hospital beds , we propose guidelines for policy-makers to properly manage future pandemics .

BACKGROUND: Kidney graft recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy may be at heightened risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and adverse outcomes. It is therefore important to characterize the clinical course and outcome of Covid-19 in this population and identify safe therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 73 adult kidney graft recipients evaluated for Covid-19 from 13 March to 20 April 2020. Primary outcomes included recovery from symptoms, acute kidney injury, graft failure and case fatality rate. RESULTS: Of the 73 patients screened, 54 tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-39 with moderate to severe symptoms requiring hospital admission and 15 with mild symptoms managed in the ambulatory setting. Hospitalized patients were more likely to be male, of Hispanic ethnicity and to have cardiovascular disease. In the hospitalized group, tacrolimus dosage was reduced in 46% of patients and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy was stopped in 61% of patients. None of the ambulatory patients had tacrolimus reduction or discontinuation of MMF. Azithromycin or doxycycline was prescribed at a similar rate among hospitalized and ambulatory patients (38% versus 40%). Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 79% of hospitalized patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide threat to humans, and neutralizing antibodies have therapeutic potential. We have purified more than 1,000 memory B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 S1 or its RBD (receptor binding domain) and obtain 729 paired heavy- and light-chain fragments. Among these, 178 antibodies test positive for antigen binding, and the majority of the top 17 binders with EC50 below 1 nM are RBD binders. Furthermore, we identify 11 neutralizing antibodies, eight of which show IC50 within 10 nM, and the best one, 414-1, with IC50 of 1.75 nM. Through epitope mapping, we find three main epitopes in RBD recognized by these antibodies, and epitope-B antibody 553-15 could substantially enhance the neutralizing abilities of most of the other antibodies. We also find that 515-5 could cross neutralize the SARS-CoV pseudovirus.

BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no direct evidence to prove the active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the intestinal tract and relevant pathological changes in the colon and rectum. We investigated the presence of virions and pathological changes in surgical rectal tissues of a clinically confirmed COVID-19 patient with rectal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: Here, the clinical data were collected during hospitalization and follow-up of this patient. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the rectal tissue specimens obtained from surgical resection, succus entericus and intestinal mucosa of ileostomy, and rectal mucosa during follow-up after recovery. Ultrathin sections of surgical samples were observed for SARS-CoV-2 virions using electron microscopy. Histopathological examination was performed using hematoxylin-eosin stain. Immunohistochemical analysis and immunofluorescence were carried out on rectal tissues to evaluate the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 antigen, and immune cell infiltrations. RESULTS: The patient had fever and cough on day 3 postoperatively, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on day 7, and was discharged from the hospital on day 41. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in surgically resected rectal specimens, but not in samples collected on 37 day after discharge. Notably, coincidence with rectal tissues of surgical specimens tested nucleic acid positive for SARS-CoV-2, typical coronavirus virions in rectal tissue were observed under electron microscopy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 400 000 people globally. Ecological evidence indicates that countries with national universal BCG vaccination programs for tuberculosis (TB) prevention have a much lower incidence of severe COVID-19 and mortality compared with those that do not have such programs. BCG is a century old vaccine used for TB prevention via infant/childhood vaccination in lowto middle-income countries with high infection prevalence rate and is known to reduce all-cause neonatal mortality. BCG remains the standard immunotherapy treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer globally for more than 44 years. Several trials are, therefore, investigating BCG as a prophylactic against COVID-19 in healthcare workers and the elderly. In this commentary, we discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie BCG associated heterologous protection with a focus on tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) organogenesis. Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (IFN-1) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity. We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive IFN-1 activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer.","bcg vaccine and covid-19 : implications for infection prophylaxis and cancer immunotherapy . \n\n the covid-19 pandemic has killed over 400 000 people globally . ecological evidence indicates that countries with national universal bcg vaccination programs for tuberculosis ( tb ) prevention have a much lower incidence of severe covid-19 and mortality compared with those that do not have such programs . bcg is a century old vaccine used for tb prevention via infant/childhood vaccination in lowto middle-income countries with high infection prevalence rate and is known to reduce all-cause neonatal mortality . bcg remains the standard immunotherapy treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer globally for more than 44 years . several trials are , therefore , investigating bcg as a prophylactic against covid-19 in healthcare workers and the elderly . in this commentary , we discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie bcg associated heterologous protection with a focus on tertiary lymphoid structure ( tls ) organogenesis . given the significance of tlss in mucosal immunity , their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of type i interferon ( ifn-1 ) in inducing these , we also discuss potentiating tls formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity . we propose that lessons learned from bcg immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive ifn-1 activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer .

Background. The beginning of 2020 has been marked by COVID-19 pandemic, with a strong impact on several national health systems worldwide.Objective. To describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of Italian psoriatic patients treated with biologics.Methods. A telephone survey was conducted in May 4-10, 2020 about the Italian lockdown period (March 09th - May 03rd 2020) in a cohort of psoriatic patients treated with biologics, asking about any exposure to COVID-19, disease status, continuation of therapy, work activity and psychological status through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).Results. 226 patients were interviewed, with no COVID-19 positive cases. Sixty-three of 226 (27.9%) described worsening of the disease with a correlation to drug withdrawal [43/226 (19%)]. Correlation was also found between the worsening of psoriasis and HADS anxiety, HADS depression, BRS and PSS abnormal scores considered both as categorical and continuous variables. No correlation was found between worsening of psoriasis and work activity.Conclusion. Uncertainty about whether biologics could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to drug withdrawal with subsequent worsening of psoriasis.

Event-based surveillance (EBS) systems monitor a broad range of information sources to detect early signals of disease emergence, including new and unknown diseases. In December 2019, a newly identified coronavirus emerged in Wuhan (China), causing a global coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the capacity of three event-based surveillance (EBS) systems (ProMED, HealthMap and PADI-web) to detect early COVID-19 emergence signals. We focused on changes in online news vocabulary over the period before/after the identification of COVID-19, while also assessing its contagiousness and pandemic potential. ProMED was the timeliest EBS, detecting signals one day before the official notification. At this early stage, the specific vocabulary used was related to ""pneumonia symptoms"" and ""mystery illness"". Once COVID-19 was identified, the vocabulary changed to virus family and specific COVID-19 acronyms. Our results suggest that the three EBS systems are complementary regarding data sources, and all require timeliness improvements. EBS methods should be adapted to the different stages of disease emergence to enhance early detection of future unknown disease outbreaks.","monitoring online media reports for early detection of unknown diseases : insight from a retrospective study of covid-19 emergence . \n\n event-based surveillance ( ebs ) systems monitor a broad range of information sources to detect early signals of disease emergence , including new and unknown diseases . in december 2019 , a newly identified coronavirus emerged in wuhan ( china ) , causing a global coronavirus disease ( covid-19 ) pandemic . a retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the capacity of three event-based surveillance ( ebs ) systems ( promed , healthmap and padi-web ) to detect early covid-19 emergence signals . we focused on changes in online news vocabulary over the period before/after the identification of covid-19 , while also assessing its contagiousness and pandemic potential . promed was the timeliest ebs , detecting signals one day before the official notification . at this early stage , the specific vocabulary used was related to `` pneumonia symptoms '' and `` mystery illness '' . once covid-19 was identified , the vocabulary changed to virus family and specific covid-19 acronyms . our results suggest that the three ebs systems are complementary regarding data sources , and all require timeliness improvements . ebs methods should be adapted to the different stages of disease emergence to enhance early detection of future unknown disease outbreaks .

Background: The clinical manifestations and factors associated with the severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections outside of Wuhan are not clearly understood. Methods: All laboratory-confirmed cases with SARS-Cov-2 infection who were hospitalized and monitored in Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital were recruited from January 20 to February 10. Results: A total of 275 patients were included in this study. The median patient age was 49 years, and 63.6% had exposure to Wuhan. The median virus incubation period was 6 days. Fever (70.5%) and dry cough (56.0%) were the most common symptoms. A decreased albumin level was found in 51.3% of patients, lymphopenia in 33.5%, and pneumonia based on chest computed tomography in 86%. Approximately 16% of patients (n = 45) had severe disease, and there were no deaths. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease were older, had a higher frequency of coexisting conditions and pneumonia, and had a shorter incubation period (all P < .05). There were no differences between patients who likely contacted the virus in Wuhan and those who had no exposure to Wuhan.

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic situation may be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate some of the ongoing transformations in modern Pathology. This refers primarily to the digitalization of the practice of tissue and cellular pathology diagnostics. However, it is also an opportunity to analyse the modus operandi of a discipline that has practiced in a similar manner for over 100 years. The challenge is to define the next generation of interconnectivity tools that would be necessary to achieve a new operational model that, while ensuring low face-to-face interaction between the main players of the diagnostic pipeline, allows maximum interconnectivity to serve our patients and the immediate teaching and research needs associated with clinical tissue/cellular samples. This viewpoint aims to describe what this new paradigm, a low-contact & high-interconnectivity pathology (LC&HC Path) operation, may require in the near future.","low-contact & high-interconnectivity pathology ( lc & hi path ) : post-covid19-pandemic practice of pathology \n\n abstract \n\n the covid-19 pandemic situation may be viewed as an opportunity to accelerate some of the ongoing transformations in modern pathology . this refers primarily to the digitalization of the practice of tissue and cellular pathology diagnostics . however , it is also an opportunity to analyse the modus operandi of a discipline that has practiced in a similar manner for over 100 years . the challenge is to define the next generation of interconnectivity tools that would be necessary to achieve a new operational model that , while ensuring low face-to-face interaction between the main players of the diagnostic pipeline , allows maximum interconnectivity to serve our patients and the immediate teaching and research needs associated with clinical tissue/cellular samples . this viewpoint aims to describe what this new paradigm , a low-contact & high-interconnectivity pathology ( lc & hc path ) operation , may require in the near future .

Objectives The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, spreads rapidly across the world. The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual's risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were collected. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score. Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. Results The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 vs. 11 (scale 0-14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001). Using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 95%, respectively. Conclusions The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters. This algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection status of patients presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms.","rapid identification of sars-cov-2-infected patients at the emergency department using routine testing . \n\n objectives the novel coronavirus disease 19 ( covid-19 ) , caused by sars-cov-2 , spreads rapidly across the world . the exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments ( ed ) . detection of sars-cov-2 is based on an rt-pcr of nasopharyngeal swab material . however , rt-pcr testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials . therefore , we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual 's risk of sars-cov-2 infection at the ed . methods in this multicenter retrospective study , routine laboratory parameters ( c-reactive protein , lactate dehydrogenase , ferritin , absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts ) , demographic data and the chest x-ray/ct result from 967 patients entering the ed with respiratory symptoms were collected . using these parameters , an easy-to-use point-based algorithm , called the corona-score , was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for sars-cov-2 by rt-pcr and those testing negative . computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score . validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients . results the corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population . patients testing negative for sars-cov-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 vs. 11 ( scale 0-14 ) in patients testing positive for sars-cov-2 ( p < 0.001 ) . using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 95 % , respectively . conclusions the corona-score effectively predicts sars-cov-2 rt-pcr outcome based on routine parameters . this algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate sars-cov-2 infection status of patients presenting at the ed with respiratory symptoms .

PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence and features of lung apical findings on neck and cervical spine CTs performed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a retrospective, IRB-approved study performed at a large academic hospital in the USA. Between March 3, 2020, and May 6, 2020, 641 patients with COVID-19 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR received medical care at our institution. A small cohort of patients with COVID-19 infection underwent neck or cervical spine CT imaging for indications including stroke, trauma, and neck pain. The lung apices included in the field of view on these CT scans were reviewed for the presence of findings suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia, including ground-glass opacities, consolidation, or crazy-paving pattern. The type and frequency of these findings were recorded and correlated with clinical information including age, gender, and symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients had neck or spine CTs performed before or concurrently with a chest CT.

46,46,32642878,COVID-19 scenario modelling for the mitigation of capacity-dependent deaths in intensive care.,"COVID-19 scenario modelling for the mitigation of capacity-dependent deaths in intensive care.

Managing healthcare demand and capacity is especially difficult in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where limited intensive care resources can be overwhelmed by a large number of cases requiring admission in a short space of time. If patients are unable to access this specialist resource, then death is a likely outcome. In appreciating these 'capacity-dependent' deaths, this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for COVID-19 patients. With application to a large public hospital in England during an early stage of the pandemic, the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity. Based on information available at the time, results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75% through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds, reducing length of stay by 25%, and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day. Accounting for the additional 'capacity-independent' deaths, which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting, yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30%. The modelling tool, which is freely available and open source, has since been used to support COVID-19 response planning at a number of healthcare systems within the UK National Health Service.","covid-19 scenario modelling for the mitigation of capacity-dependent deaths in intensive care . \n\n managing healthcare demand and capacity is especially difficult in the context of the covid-19 pandemic , where limited intensive care resources can be overwhelmed by a large number of cases requiring admission in a short space of time . if patients are unable to access this specialist resource , then death is a likely outcome . in appreciating these 'capacity-dependent ' deaths , this paper reports on the clinically-led development of a stochastic discrete event simulation model designed to capture the key dynamics of the intensive care admissions process for covid-19 patients . with application to a large public hospital in england during an early stage of the pandemic , the purpose of this study was to estimate the extent to which such capacity-dependent deaths can be mitigated through demand-side initiatives involving non-pharmaceutical interventions and supply-side measures to increase surge capacity . based on information available at the time , results suggest that total capacity-dependent deaths can be reduced by 75 % through a combination of increasing capacity from 45 to 100 beds , reducing length of stay by 25 % , and flattening the peak demand to 26 admissions per day . accounting for the additional 'capacity-independent ' deaths , which occur even when appropriate care is available within the intensive care setting , yields an aggregate reduction in total deaths of 30 % . the modelling tool , which is freely available and open source , has since been used to support covid-19 response planning at a number of healthcare systems within the uk national health service .

Background: Since December 2019, we have been facing one of the worst pandemics of human history. It originated from the Hubei province in China as a case of pneumonia, later named COVID-19.1 The causative pathogen, a new enveloped betacoronavirus2 is now known as Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV 2). India reported its first case of COVID19, on 30th January 2020. We aim to identify the defining clinical and radiological characteristics, severity and prognosis, along with impact of age on outcome. Methods: Cross sectional, observational study of patients diagnosed with COVID -19 [RT-PCR]. Results: We observed male predominance, mean age of 36 years, with less or no symptoms, majority brought in after screening and contact tracing by the screening teams. Thrombocytopenia, lymphocytosis, raised LDH was common (>35%, p<0.05). Patients over the age of 60 were the ones having severe illness and more complications (p<0.05). Radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity. Poor prognosis was noted in elderly, especially those with co-morbidities. Discussion: Though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent, patients aged >=60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality. Clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases. Increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into. Chest X-ray proves sufficient for imaging, reducing the requirement of CT scans. Studies involving larger sample size and interventional trials are need of the hour.","covid 19- clinical profile , radiological presentation , prognostic predictors , complications and outcome : a perspective from the indian subcontinent . \n\n background : since december 2019 , we have been facing one of the worst pandemics of human history . it originated from the hubei province in china as a case of pneumonia , later named covid-19.1 the causative pathogen , a new enveloped betacoronavirus2 is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 ( sars-cov 2 ) . india reported its first case of covid19 , on 30th january 2020 . we aim to identify the defining clinical and radiological characteristics , severity and prognosis , along with impact of age on outcome . methods : cross sectional , observational study of patients diagnosed with covid -19 [ rt-pcr ] . results : we observed male predominance , mean age of 36 years , with less or no symptoms , majority brought in after screening and contact tracing by the screening teams . thrombocytopenia , lymphocytosis , raised ldh was common ( > 35 % , p < 0.05 ) . patients over the age of 60 were the ones having severe illness and more complications ( p < 0.05 ) . radiographic abnormality was frequently associated irrespective of clinical presentation and its severity . poor prognosis was noted in elderly , especially those with co-morbidities . discussion : though the disease has a relatively mild course in this part of the subcontinent , patients aged > =60 are at significant risk for morbidity and mortality . clinical and laboratory findings are similar to those found in viral diseases . increased risk of cardiac involvement needs to be looked into . chest x-ray proves sufficient for imaging , reducing the requirement of ct scans . studies involving larger sample size and interventional trials are need of the hour .

COVID-19 emerged as a viral pandemic in the year 2019. The practice and scope of surgery and medicine transformed radicially as the virus spread across the world. There is an urgent need to understand the outcomes of COVID-19 infected patients who undergo surgery. We present a comprehensive review of the current literature on the management of surgical patients who develop COVID-19. FINDINGS: Poor outcomes were most frequent in general surgery or oncological surgery patients who were older with chronic comorbidities. In contrast, outcomes among transplant surgery and obstetric patients were not signficantly altered by COVID-19. Surgical societies have released specialty specific guidelines on the managment of patients who require surgical care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality in surgical patients. Data is currently limited, often restricted to single sites and smaller cohorts. As the sequelae of the virus is better understood, the revisions to the guidelines on managment of surgical patients may help improve outcomes.","review of covid-19 outcomes in surgical patients . \n\n covid-19 emerged as a viral pandemic in the year 2019 . the practice and scope of surgery and medicine transformed radicially as the virus spread across the world . there is an urgent need to understand the outcomes of covid-19 infected patients who undergo surgery . we present a comprehensive review of the current literature on the management of surgical patients who develop covid-19 . findings : poor outcomes were most frequent in general surgery or oncological surgery patients who were older with chronic comorbidities . in contrast , outcomes among transplant surgery and obstetric patients were not signficantly altered by covid-19 . surgical societies have released specialty specific guidelines on the managment of patients who require surgical care during the pandemic . conclusion : covid-19 is associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality in surgical patients . data is currently limited , often restricted to single sites and smaller cohorts . as the sequelae of the virus is better understood , the revisions to the guidelines on managment of surgical patients may help improve outcomes .
